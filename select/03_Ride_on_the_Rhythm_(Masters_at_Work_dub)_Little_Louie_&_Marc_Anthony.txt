I want to ride on the rhythm
And groove to that nasty funky beat
And when it pumps I go crazy,
I'm gonna make you get on up and move your feet
Cause when the rhythm's right
It'll make you move all night
It's gonna keep you coming back for more
And when the beat is strong,
You'll party all night long
You'll party till you can't take any more.
I want to ride on the rhythm,
I don't ever want to stop
I don't ever want to stop.
I want to ride on the rhythm,
I don't ever want to stop
Cause it feels so good to me
I want to ride on the rhythm
I don't ever want to stop
I don't ever want to stop, no
I want to ride on the rhythm,
I don't ever want to stop
Cause it feel so good.

I'm gonna dance to the music
Cause the music takes me where I want to be
I want to get down when I use it
Cause I know the boomin' beat will set me free
Cause when the rhythm's right
It'll make you move all night
It's gonna keep you coming back for more
And when the beat is strong,
You'll party all night long
You'll party till you can't take any more.
I want to ride on the rhythm,
I don't ever want to stop
I don't ever want to stop.
I want to ride on the rhythm,
I don't ever want to stop
Cause it feel so good to me
I want to ride on the rhythm,
I don't ever want to stop
I don't ever want to stop, no
I want to ride on the rhythm,
I don't ever want to stop
Cause it feel so good.
Ride on the rhythm,
Ride on the rhythm,
Ride on the rhythm,
R... i... d... e
Ride on the rhythm,
Ride on the rhythm,
Ride on the rhythm,
R... i... d... e
