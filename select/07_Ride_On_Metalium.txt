Hear the charming voice out in the night
Sail on, don't go there you'll lose your life

They who are lost will find the spellbound sirens
They who seduce the blind

Ride on (ride on), into your ruin
Voices dictate your way (your way)
Ride on to where we are ruling
Our power is here to stay

Draw near stop thy ship and come to us
Dead man you will see oh what a loss

They who are lost will find the spellbound sirens
They who seduce the blind

Ride on (ride on), into your ruin
Voices dictate your way (your way)
Ride on to where we are ruling
Our power is here to stay

Ride on (ride on), into your ruin
Voices dictate your way (your way)
Ride on to where we are ruling
Our power is here to stay
